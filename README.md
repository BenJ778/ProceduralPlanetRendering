## About

Simple Realtime procedural planet rendering application. 
Implemented using C/C++, OpenGL, and NVIDIA Cg.

## Features

- Seamless Patches for GPU-Based Terrain Rendering* 

- Deferred Shading

- Precomputed Atmospheric Scattering

- In-flight terrain height map generation using GPU procedural noises

- Virtual Texturing

*Â Slightly modified for spherical surface tessellation.
